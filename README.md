# hyperbole
A slightly catchier name that HWPURBP (Hybrid Wordpress Universal React Boilerplate).

## Overview
There are 2 big parts to this: the Wordpress part, and the React-Redux Universal part.
And there is also some proxying that helps them play nicely together. In the repo we have a an nginx conf that I like to use when I'm developing locally, but in other contexts, like in aws, for example, I would replicate the same sort of proxying with cloudfront/load balancers.
